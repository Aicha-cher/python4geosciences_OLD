    "# Coding outside of Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used Jupyter notebooks in this class as a useful tool for integrating text and interactive, usable code. However, most real life coding work would not use Jupyter notebooks but would instead be accomplished by typing the code in text files and then running them via a terminal window or in iPython. Many of you have done this before, perhaps analogously in Matlab by writing your code in a `.m` file and then running it in the Matlab GUI. Writing code in a separate file allows more heavy computations as well as allowing that code to be reused more easily that when it is written in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will demonstrate typing Python code in a `.py` file and then running it in an iPython window."

You can then go back and forth, trying things out in iPython, and keeping what works in the text window so that you finish with a working script, which can be run independently in the future. This is, of course, what you've been doing when you use Jupyter notebooks, except everything is combined into one place in that sort of setup. If you are familiar with Matlab, this is what you are used to when you have your Matlab window with your `*.m` text window alongside a \"terminal window\" where you can type things. (There is also a variable viewer included in Matlab.)\n",

    "A good text editor should be able to highlight syntax – that is, use color and font style to differentiate between special key words and types for a given programming language. This is what has been happening in our Jupyter notebooks, when strings are colored red, for example. The editors will also key off typical behaviors in the language to try to be helpful, such as when in a Jupyter notebook if you write an `if` statement with a colon at the end and push `enter`, the next line will be automatically indented so that you can just start typing. These behaviors can be adjusted by changing user settings.\n",

    "# E. Unit testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of unit testing is to develop tests for your code as you develop it, so that you automatically know if it is working properly as you make changes. In fact, some coders prefer to write the unit tests first to drive the proper development of their code and to know when it is working. Of course, the quality of the testing is made up of the tests you include and aspects of your code that you test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some unit test [guidelines](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generally, you want to write unit tests that test one small aspect of your code functionality, as separately as possible from other parts of it. Then write many of these tests to cover all aspects of functionality.\n",
    "* Make sure your unit tests run very quickly since you may end up with many of them\n",
    "* Always run the full test suite before a coding session, and run it again after. This will give you more confidence that you did not break anything in the rest of the code.\n",
    "* You can now run a program like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) through GitHub which runs your test suite before you push your code to your repository or merge a pull request.\n",
    "* Use long and descriptive names for testing functions. The style guide here is slightly different than that of running code, where short names are often preferred. The reason is testing functions are never called explicitly. square() or even sqr() is ok in running code, but in testing code you would have names such as test_square_of_number_2(), test_square_negative_number(). These function names are displayed when a test fails, and should be as descriptive as possible.\n",
    "* Include detailed docstrings and comments throughout your testing files since these may be read more than the original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to set up a suite of unit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make a `tests` directory in your code (or for simple code, just have your test file in the same directory);\n",
    "1. make a new file to hold your tests, called `tests*.py` — it must start with \"test\" for it to be noticed by testing programs;\n",
    "1. inside `tests*.py`, write a test function called `test_*()` — the testing programs look for functions with these names in particular and ignore other functions;\n",
    "1. use functions like `assert` and `np.allclose` for numeric comparisons of function outputs and checking for output types.\n",
    "1. run testing programs on your code. I recommend [nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html) or [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/). You use these by running `nosetests` or `py.test` from the terminal window in the directory with your test code in it (or pointing to the directory)."

    "# H. Documentation generation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) is a program that can be run to generate documentation for your project from your docstrings. You basically run the program and if you use the proper formatting in your docstrings, they will all be properly pulled out and presented nicely in a coherent way. There are various additions you can use with Sphinx in order to be able to write your docstrings in different formats (as shown above) and still have Sphinx be able to interpret them. For example, you can use [Napoleon](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) with Sphinx to be able to write using the Google style instead of reST, meaning that you can have much more readable docstrings and still get nicely-generated documentation out. Once you have generated this documentation, you can publish it using [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/). Here is documentation on readthedocs for a package that converts between colorspaces, [Colorspacious](https://colorspacious.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\n",

I also use one for documentation for a package of mine, [cmocean](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) that provides colormaps for oceanography.

The top 20% of the colormap, after the divergence, is colored yellow to highlight the supersaturated water. The minimum and maximum values of this colormap are meant to be controlled in order to properly place the low oxygen and supersaturated oxygen states properly. This colormap was developed for the Mississippi river plume area where both low and supersaturated conditions are regularly seen and monitored. Examples of this colormap (without colorbar limits being controlled to set the values of the red and yellow regions) are shown from Texas A&M University gliders. Nicknames for this colormap are 'oxygen' and 'o2', and the units are typically given as [m/l].\n",

There are also a number of technical steps you'll need to do. More information about this sort of process is [available online](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/minimal.html)."
