* Don't forget to regularly `git pull` in your terminal window or `Sync` in GitHub Desktop in the course repository to get the latest materials. Note that if you have changed any of the files locally (for example, because you were following along in class and changed the code) and want to just discard those changes, you can use `git checkout -- [file_that_changed]` to reset the file.
