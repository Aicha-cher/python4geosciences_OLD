* Don't use numpy for hw02 since we haven't gotten to that point yet. We want you to learn the core language first.

### 1/26/16

* Meeting in 602 from now on. This is to enable group work especially â€” we encourage you to work with your neighbor on exercises during class.
* Don't forget to regularly `git pull` in your terminal window or `Sync` in GitHub Desktop in the course repository to get the latest materials. Note that if you have changed any of the files locally (for example, because you were following along in class and changed the code) and want to just discard those changes, you can use `git checkout -- [file_that_changed]` to reset the file.
* Remember: hw02 is due Tuesday Feb. 2nd. Please join the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python4geosciences2016) and the associated calendar to stay up to date on the course timing.
* We've set up a course in eCampus for sharing grades.
