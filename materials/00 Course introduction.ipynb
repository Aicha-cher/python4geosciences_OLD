The code can be written in over 40 languages including Python, R, and Scala. Most importantly, the code can be interacted with when the notebook is opened in a local (that is, on your computer) iPython server. Alternatively, it can simply be viewed through a github repository (like [this very notebook](https://github.com/hetland/python4geosciences/blob/master/materials/00%20Course%20introduction.ipynb)) or through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). \n",
