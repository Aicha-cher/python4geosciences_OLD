# Group Projects

Grad students should get together in groups of 2-3 people, or work on their own, to do an in-depth investigation of a dataset and/or Python package, to be presented during the last week of class and final exam period, worth 25% of the overall grade. Undergrads do not need to complete a project, but they are required to attend the presentations, participate, and give feedback. The project is intentionally open-ended to encourage you to explore on your own, particularly if you have research-related questions you can address. Students will present on the material for about 10 minutes each, so larger groups will present for longer and need to have proportionally larger or more in-depth projects. Below is a list of ideas of packages and datasets to consider:

## Packages:

- scikit-learn (machine learning)
- scikit-image (image processing)
- pymc (Bayesian analysis)
- PySal (social geography analysis)
- Fiona/Shapely (reading and using GIS shape files)
- Cartopy/Iris (reading and plotting map-based data)
- Widgets (in Jupyter or otherwise)
- Bokeh, Mayavi (specialized, powerful plotting packages)


## Datasets:

- IPCC/climate data
- Social datasets (crime or health statistics by county)
- Radar data (may have its own analysis Python package)
- Glider data (e.g. from GCOOS)
- Satellite images (NASA)
- Twitter usage data
